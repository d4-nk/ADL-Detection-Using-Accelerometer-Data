# ADL-Detection-Using-Accelerometer-Data

This was a Machine Learning based project with the aim of finding optimal features for the given dataset
and testing out the accuracy on various classifiers.
A proper guide for running the code will be updated later.

For now you can check the Project Report.pdf for the analysis
